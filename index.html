            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Inferno is the first part of Dante Alighieri’s epic poem The Divine Comedy, written in the early 14th century. This monumental work is a cornerstone of Italian literature and a profound exploration of the human condition. The Inferno describes Dante’s journey through Hell, guided by the Roman poet Virgil. The narrative is both an allegory and a reflection of Dante’s own life, filled with political and personal turmoil.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dante begins his journey lost in a dark wood, symbolizing his moral confusion and loss of direction. He encounters three beasts that block his path: a leopard, a lion, and a she-wolf, representing different sins and obstacles. Virgil appears as a guide sent by Beatrice, Dante’s idealized woman, who resides in Heaven. Together, they embark on a journey through the nine circles of Hell, each representing a different sin and its corresponding punishment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure of Hell in Inferno is meticulously detailed, with each circle designed to reflect the nature of the sins committed. This concept of contrapasso, where the punishment fits the crime, is central to the poem’s moral and theological framework. Dante’s vivid descriptions and imaginative vision have made Inferno a lasting influence on literature and art.

            <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Dante’s journey begins in a dark forest where he is lost and confused. He is confronted by three beasts that prevent him from ascending a mountain representing Heaven. In despair, he meets Virgil, who offers to guide him through Hell and Purgatory to reach Heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                As they travel through the nine circles of Hell, Dante witnesses the punishments of various sinners, each tailored to reflect the nature of their sins. The poem is a reflection of Dante’s own moral and spiritual journey, exploring themes of justice, redemption, and the human condition.
            </p>

        <section id="circles">
            <h2>Circles of Hell</h2>

            <h3>The First Circle: Limbo</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Harrowhell.jpg/170px-Harrowhell.jpg" alt="The First Circle: Limbo" />
            <p>
                The first circle, Limbo, houses virtuous pagans and unbaptized infants who live in a deficient form of Heaven. Here, Dante meets classical poets and philosophers, including Homer and Aristotle.
            </p>

            <h3>The Second Circle: Lust</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Inferno_Canto_5_line_4_Minos.jpg/260px-Inferno_Canto_5_line_4_Minos.jpg" alt="The Second Circle: Lust" />
            <p>
                In the second circle, Lust, sinners are blown about by violent winds, symbolizing their lack of self-control. Dante encounters historical and mythological figures such as Cleopatra and Helen of Troy.
            </p>

            <h3>The Third Circle: Gluttony</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Inferno_Canto_6_lines_24-26.jpg/220px-Inferno_Canto_6_lines_24-26.jpg" alt="The Third Circle: Gluttony" />
            <p>
                The third circle, Gluttony, is a place of cold, filthy rain where the gluttonous lie in the mud, tormented by Cerberus.
            </p>

            <h3>The Fourth Circle: Greed</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_Dante_Alighieri_-_Inferno_-_Plate_22_%28Canto_VII_-_Hoarders_and_Wasters%29.jpg/220px-Gustave_Dor%C3%A9_-_Dante_Alighieri_-_Inferno_-_Plate_22_%28Canto_VII_-_Hoarders_and_Wasters%29.jpg" alt="The Fourth Circle: Greed" />
            <p>
                The fourth circle, Greed, is divided into two groups: the hoarders and the spendthrifts, who push heavy weights against each other in a futile struggle.
            </p>

            <h3>The Fifth Circle: Wrath</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Stradano_Inferno_Canto_08.jpg/220px-Stradano_Inferno_Canto_08.jpg" alt="The Fifth Circle: Wrath" />
            <p>
                The fifth circle, Wrath, is a swampy river where the wrathful fight on the surface while the sullen lie beneath, gurgling in the black mud.
            </p>

            <h3>The Sixth Circle: Heresy</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Stradano_Inferno_Map_Lower.jpg/260px-Stradano_Inferno_Map_Lower.jpg" alt="The Sixth Circle: Heresy" />
            <p>
                In the sixth circle, Heresy, heretics are trapped in flaming tombs. Dante meets notable figures such as Farinata degli Uberti, a political leader from Florence.
            </p>

            <h3>The Seventh Circle: Violence</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Inf._12_anonimo_fiorentino.jpg" alt="The Seventh Circle: Violence" />
            <p>
                The seventh circle, Violence, is divided into three rings: violence against others, against oneself, and against God. Each ring has its own unique punishments, such as boiling in blood or being transformed into trees.
            </p>

            <h3>The Eighth Circle: Fraud</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Stradano_Inferno_Canto_20.jpg/220px-Stradano_Inferno_Canto_20.jpg" alt="The Eighth Circle: Fraud" />
            <p>
                The eighth circle, Fraud, is a vast, stony landscape with ten ditches, each housing different types of fraudulent sinners, including flatterers, sorcerers, and thieves.
            </p>

            <h3>The Ninth Circle: Treachery</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Gustave_Dore_Inferno32.jpg/310px-Gustave_Dore_Inferno32.jpg" alt="The Ninth Circle: Treachery" />
            <p>
                The ninth and final circle, Treachery, is a frozen lake where traitors are encased in ice, with Satan himself at the center, chewing on the worst traitors: Judas Iscariot, Brutus, and Cassius.
